      description: "Dead Ringer is an homage to a benchmark of the American IPA style thatâ€™s brewed in Michigan. American base malt and crystal malt create the big body and supporting grainy sweetness, while charge after charge of 100% Centennial Type hops deliver pronounced bitterness with a dominant citrus aroma and flavor. In the glass you get a pale amber color, hop intensity and malt density - substance with the soul of a session beer.",
